The basic Pokemon Card Battle

What a project. I pushed the limits of what I thought I could do and created something awesome. This game was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and some third party resources through things like an API pull using ajax or image and sound files. 

The project started as a simple idea, I came up with the idea of creating my own basic version of the Pokemon card battle game and thought it was an achievable goal. From general conception came wireframing. The first thing I did was draw out an idea of what I wanted the game to look like. Then I began to jot down some bullets of features I wanted to add and how I planned to go about certain obstacles. I wasn’t originally planning on using an API, but the idea was recommended to me and I thought I would give it a try. From there I would pick a piece of my wireframe or my logic ideas and work to make it into a reality coming up with new ideas along the way. Then, piece by piece, the game began to come together. I tried to work on things that correlated to each other in a logical fashion (ex. Building the 3 rows and then filling them with cards). Eventually, I created something I was proud of.

I solved most problems and fixed almost every bug I saw but there were some issues I could not get repeats of. Like, for example, there were times when there would be an error pulling from the API and only 9 cards would be pulled but it was very rare and only happened to me 3 times throughout my testing. Likely something to do with cache or how many requests I would send one after another. Another issue that I simply could not fix so I rather made a work around for was sometimes you get a 404 error when pulling from the API and the image of the card will only be a blank back of a Pokemon card. Again, I couldn’t fix this in a plausible way so I made a reset button that solves these two issues. There was one feature I had thought about adding but never got around to and that was an option to “return” or change out your Pokemon. I think it was possible but I wasn’t sure if it was a feature I really wanted.
