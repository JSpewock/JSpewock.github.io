            <h2>How to play the basic Pokemon Card battle!</h2>
            <p>When the game starts there will be 10 completely random cards given out evenly, 5 to you and 5 to the computer. You will then be prompted to choose a card to send out and once you choose a card, the computer will do the same. These cards are then moved to the center "live card" area and are ready for battle! Then if you click the "Attack" button in the bottom left hand side of the center box, you will attack the opponent for the amount of damage listed on the card.</p>
            <p>IMPORTANT NOTES: If your pokemon has 2 or more moves it will ALWAYS use the second move listed on the card. If there is no second move or the second move does not do damage, it will then use the first one. Finally, if your card has no moves that do damage, you will recieve a default attack value of 10. There are no type advantages, no abilities, the conditions on moves will be ignored, and only base damage value will be applied.</p>
