                <h2>How to play the basic Pokemon Card battle!</h2>
                <p>When the game starts there will be 10 completely random cards given out evenly, 5 to you and 5 to the computer. You will then be prompted to choose a card to send out and once you choose a card, the computer will do the same. These cards are then moved to the center "live card" area and are ready for battle! Then if you click the "Attack" button in the top left hand corner of the center box, you will attack the opponent for the amount of damage listed on the card. This game is turned based so you will go first but even if you manage to defeat the opponents card, he will get a free attack with his new card.</p>
                <p>IMPORTANT NOTES: If your pokemon has 2 or more moves it will ALWAYS use the second move listed on the card. If there is no second move or the second move does not do damage, it will then use the first one. Finally, if your card has no moves that do damage, you will recieve a default attack value of 10. There are no type advantages, no abilities, the conditions on moves will be ignored, and only base damage value will be applied. There is also a rare chance that you will receive a card that has no hp. In this case, the hp value will be defaulted to 100. Additionally, there can be errors when generating cards causing their image to simply just be the back of a card but, if you run into this issue, simply click the reset button next to your cards. Good luck and have fun!</p>
